# wifiprep

# DISCLAIMER

This program was conceived to automatically assign a random MAC address to a wifi card and run it in monitor mode.

I am aware it would probably be easier to write a bash file for this, but I wrote this program anyway to practice go programming. 

Hope you find this useful

# USAGE

$ go run wifiprep.go -i (wifi card interface)
